# CoinTrack
Display list of top 100 crypto coins and show details with interactive chart of selected coin.

## Building 
- This application is built using XCode 14 and iOS SDK 16 
- Minimum deployment target should be iOS 16 - since its using newly introduced charts api of Swift UI which is only available in iOS 16

## Dependencies 
- SWift Cached Async Image - used for loading and caching coin images. (nice wrapper around default AsyncImageView which lakes caching functionality)
